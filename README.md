#This is the solution for Odin project Project: Javascript/jQuery.

This is the my first HTML with jQuery. Feel free to quit reading:)

From this project, I learnt to use "for" loop, "onclick" function for the <button> element, use css() to style the html, use var inside the argument of css(), and how use float to make a 16X16 grid.

The things should be research: How to make the javascript simple, as now it looks "heavy" and "repeated".
