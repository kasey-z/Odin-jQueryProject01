#This is the solution for Odin project Project: Javascript/jQuery.

This is the my first HTML with jQuery. So feel free to quit reading:)

From this project, I learnt to use "for" loop, "onclick" function for the <button> element, use css() to style the html, use var inside the argument of css(), and how use float to make a 16X16 grid.

2017.5.17: The things should be research: How to make the javascript simple, as now it looks "heavy" and "repeated".

2017.5.18: already put the repeated into a named function. Now it is simpler and easier to read. Sometime it is important to put the parameter inside the function().
